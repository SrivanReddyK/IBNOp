# Intent Based Networking Optimization for evolving networks
Intent Based Network Optimization Test Bench setup for AI network Analysis and Optimization based on Raspberry Pi and ESP32 

We want to create a test bench that can help us acheive intent based networking and to aid understanding of how sub millisecond latency optimizations can work
